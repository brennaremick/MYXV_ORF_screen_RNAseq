# MYXV_ORF_screen_RNAseq
Code in this repository was used to analyze bulk RNA barcoding and sequencing data from BLaER1 monocytes expressing individual myxoma virus ORFs; from the manuscript: "Attack of host anti-viral pathways by a myxoma virus virulence factor unleashes effector-triggered NF-ÎºB signaling"
